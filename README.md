# Chat-App-using-sockets


This is a Socket based Application developed as a requirement for the completion of Concordia University's COMP-6231 Distributed System Design Course. The concepts of socket programming and multi-threading are leveraged to achieve this task.

In this chat room, clients connect to a remote server with a designated IP and port number. The server accepts connections from an arbitrary number of clients. Any message sent from one client is broadcast to all other clients.

## Steps To Run the Group Chat Room
1. Run the Server.java file to initiate the Server host.
2. Run the Client.java multiple times to initiate multiple client host.
3. Type a message from any of the client to broadcast it to everyone.
4. To disconnect a client type “quit” .
