# Chat-App-using-sockets


This is a Socket based Application developed as a requirement for the completion of Concordia University's COMP-6231 Distributed System Design Course. The concepts of socket programming and multi-threading are leveraged to achieve this task.

In this chat room, clients connect to a remote server with a designated IP and port number. The server accepts connections from an arbitrary number of clients. Any message sent from one client is broadcast to all other clients.
